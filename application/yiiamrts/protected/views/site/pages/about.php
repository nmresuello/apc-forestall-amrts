<h1>About</h1>

<p>Forestall Insurance Agency Corporation (FIAC) was born though the concept of its Chief Executive Officer, Micaela U. Sone.</p>

<p>With extensive experience in insurance, both life and non-life, she had a vision of a company that would provide quality, adequate and appropriate insurance protection and coverage to people and other companies. </p>

<p>With this in mind, she gathered together people from varied backgrounds that share the same vision as hers. These people have broad experience and expertise in their various disciplines and they all have insurance knowledge in their chosen fields. This in turn gives FIAC fresh and objective perspectives on what insurance products are appropriate for each individual person and company.</p>

<p>FIAC represents some of the top life and non-life companies in the Philippines today. Each company must meet strict criteria based on net income, assets, paid up capital, track record and overall company health before we can consider representing them. This stringent selection helps ensure prime coverage for all our clients. .</p>
